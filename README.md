# Climate_Change-Agriculture-Analysis
## Project Goal
I analyzed this Kaggle dataset to see how climate factors like CO2 and Temperature affect food production. I wanted to identify which regions are struggling and which farming strategies actually work.

## Dashboard 1: Agricultural Productivity Analysis
**Key Insights:**
* **Top Performer:** The **North Central** region is a leader in productivity, specifically achieving a yield of **2.71** for Corn.
* **Regional Gaps:** The **South East** and **South West** regions show lower average yields, indicating a need for targeted support.

**Key Insights:**
* **Economic Toll:** Extreme weather events have contributed to an estimated economic impact of **$523.58K**.
* **Weather Volatility:** There are over **3,725 extreme weather events** recorded, which correlate with the fluctuations seen in crop yields.
* **Yield Benchmark:** The average global crop yield is **2.30 MT/HA** despite rising CO2 emissions of **14.92 MT**.

**Key Insights:**
* **Winning Strategies:** **Organic Farming** and **Drought-resistant Crops** are the most effective strategies for maintaining high yields.
* **Soil Health:** High soil health categories generally lead to more stable yields across different irrigation levels.

## Conclusion
Through this analysis, it is clear that climate change is no longer just an environmental concern but a significant economic risk to agriculture. With over **3,725 extreme weather events** impacting productivity, we can see that traditional farming is struggling to keep pace with rising temperatures and CO2 levels. However, the data also shows a path toward resilience through smarter adaptation strategies.

## Recommendations
Based on the dashboards, I recommend the following actions for stakeholders:

* **Invest in Adaptation:** Prioritize the transition to **Organic Farming** and **Drought-Resistant Crops**, as these show the most stable yields in the current climate.
* **Financial Protection:** Create targeted insurance for **Corn** and **Fruit** crops, which currently bear the highest share of the **$523.58K** economic impact.
* **Regional Knowledge Sharing:** Model the irrigation and soil health practices of the **North Central** region (the leader in Corn productivity) to support lower-performing areas like the South East.
* **Early Warning Systems:** Expand the use of weather-tracking data to better prepare for the high frequency of extreme weather events.
